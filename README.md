<h2>Description:</h2>

This is a web application for people who want to give or receive something as a gift, but cannot openly ask or hint about it. The platform allows users to create friendships with other users, after which they can see each other's wishlists and anonymously reserve them to give in the future. The user whose gift was reserved will not even know about the reservation, but other friends will be able to see that someone already intends to give it.
